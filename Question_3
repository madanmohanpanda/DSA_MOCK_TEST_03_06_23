3. Create a class called Person with private properties like name, age, and address. Provide public getter and setter methods for these properties. 
Write a program that creates an instance of the Person class, sets values for its properties using the setter methods, and displays the values using 
the getter methods.

class Person{
    privet String name;
    privet int age ;
    privet String address;
    public Person(String name, int age, String address){
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.address = address;
    }
public  void setDetails(String name, int age, String address){
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.address = address;
    }
    public void getDetails(){
          System.out.println("Name : "+ name+"age is : "+ age+ "Address is : "+ address);
    }
}

class Main{
  public static void main(String []a){
    Person p1 = new Person();
    p1.setDetails("Madan", 23, "Bhubaneswar");
    p1.getDetails();
  }
}
